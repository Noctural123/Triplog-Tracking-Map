# Triplog Tracking Project
This project implements the graphical user interfaces (GUI) in java to display a map tracking the path that my professor, Dr. Maiti, went on during his trip. It uses real-world data of time, longitude, and latitude coordinates stored in a CSV file, reads it, and then outputs and tracks the path taken.

## Usage

Once the "Play/Reset" Button is pressed the trail will run and will take the exact path using coordinates read in from the CSV file.
